# Project 01: Hello World

1.  **Introduction**
    
    For Raspberry Pi Pico beginners, we will start with some simple
    things. In this project, you only need a Raspberry Pi Pico and a USB
    cable to complete the "Hello World\!" project, which is a test of
    communication between Raspberry Pi Pico and the PC as well as a
    primary project.

3.  **Wiring Up**
    
    In this project, we use a USB cable to connect the Raspberry Pi Pico
    to the computer.

4.  **Online running code:**
    
    To run the Raspberry Pi Pico online, you need to connect the
    Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer, which allows you to compile or
    debug programs using Thonny software.  
    
    Advantages:
    
    1\. You can use the Thonny software to compile or debug programs.
    
    2.Through the "Shell" window, you can view error messages and output
    results generated during the running of the program as well as query
    related function information online to help improve the program.  
    
    Disadvantages:

<!-- end list -->

1.  To run the Raspberry Pi Pico online, you must connect the Raspberry
    Pi Pico to a computer and run it with the Thonny software.  

<!-- end list -->

2.  If the Raspberry Pi Pico is disconnected from the computer, when
    they reconnect, the program won't run again.  
    
    Basic Operation:
