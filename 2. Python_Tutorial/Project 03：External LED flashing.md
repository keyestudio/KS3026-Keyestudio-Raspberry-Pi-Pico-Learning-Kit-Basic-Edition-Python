# Project 03：External LED flashing

1.  **Introduction**
    
    In this project, we are going to show you the external LED flashing
    effect.  We will use the Raspberry Pi Pico's digital pins to turn on
    the LED and make it flash.

3.  **Knowledge**

**（1）LED:**

![](/media/081141eed6146deed2bfbd8e55a8465b.jpeg)

The LED is a kind of semiconductor called “light-emitting diode”, which
is an electronic device made from semiconducting materials (silicon,
selenium, germanium, etc.).  It has a anode and a cathode.  The short
lead is cathode, which connects to GND, the long lead is anode , which
connects to3.3V or 5V.

2.  ** 5-band Resistor**
    
    A resistor is an electronic component in a circuit that restricts or
    regulates the flow current flow. On the left is the appearance of
    the resistor and on the right is the symbol for the resistance in
    the circuit . Its unit is(Ω). 1 mΩ= 1000 kΩ，1kΩ= 1000Ω.

We can use resistors to protect sensitive components, such as LEDs. The
strength of the resistance is marked on the body of the resistor with an
electronic color code. Each color code represents a number, and you can
refer to it in a resistance card.

\-Color 1 – 1st Digit

\-Color 2 – 2nd Digit

\-Color 3 – 3rd Digit

\-Color 4 – Multiplier

\-Color 5 – Tolerance

In this kit, we provide three 5-band resistors with different resistance
values. Take three 5-band resistors as an example.

220Ω resistor\*10

10KΩ resistor\*10

1KΩ resistor\*10

![](/media/19f5dfc51adfd79b04c3b164529767ed.png)

In the same voltage, there will be less current and more resistance. The
connection between current, voltage, and resistance can be expressed by
the formula: I=U/R. In the figure below, if the voltage is 3V, the
current through R1 is: I = U / R = 3 V / 10 KΩ= 0.0003A=
0.3mA.![](/media/b3eec552e4dfad361833730698621776.png)

Do not directly connect resistors with very low resistance to the two
poles of the power supply, as this will cause excessive current to
damage the electronic components. Resistors do not have positive and
negative poles.

3.  **Breadboard**

A breadboard is used to build and test circuits quickly before
finalizing any circuit design. The breadboard has many holes , into
which circuit components like integrated circuits and resistors can be
inserted. A typical breadboard is as follows.

![](/media/612c1381811b2d780d5f6ed6a7ec3701.png)

The bread board has strips of metal , which run underneath the board and
connect the holes on the top of the board. The metal strips are laid out
as shown below. Note that the top and bottom rows of holes are connected
horizontally while the remaining holes are connected vertically.

![](/media/b45e70b961537035c85878b73d371725.png)

The first two rows (top) and the last two rows (bottom) of the
breadboard are used for the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals of
the power supply, respectively. The conductive layout of the breadboard
is shown in the following diagram.

![](/media/d5478bd5eac558252cbc235479d979eb.png)

When we connect DIP (Dual In-line Packages) components, such as
integrated circuits, microcontrollers, chips and so on, we can see that
a groove in the middle isolates the middle part, so the top and bottom
of the groove is not connected. DIP components can be connected as shown
in the figure below:

In this project, we use a USB to connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to the
computer. Please refer to the documentation for connection methods:

4.  **Circuit Diagram and Wiring Diagram**

First, cut all power to the Raspberry Pi Pico.  Then build the circuit
according to the circuit diagram and wiring diagram.  After the circuits
are set up and verified, using a USB cable to connect the Raspberry Pi
Pico to a computer .  Note: Avoid any possible short circuits
(especially connecting 3.3V and GND)\!

Warning: A short circuit may cause a large current in the circuit,
causing components to overheat and permanent damage to the hardware.

5.  **Test Code**

According to the circuit diagram, when the GP16 output of the Pico is
high, the LED will light up;  When the output power is low, the LED will
light off.  Therefore, we can make the LED flash repeatedly by
controlling the GP16 to repeatedly output high and low levels.
